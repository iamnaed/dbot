[1] Since Odrive is implemented in Python, I need to make 
    a Python package that runs the "odrive" module that can
    be downloaded from their website.
    Except, ros2_control's hardware interface can only be written in
    c++, hence the problem.

    Possible solutions:
        [a] Make an python node that publishes the data from the Odrive
            to a given topic. [eg. /odrive_pos, /odrive_vel]
            Have the hardware interface, read from the topic.
            [Might not work]

        [2] Use odrive_hardware_interface in odrive_ros2_control from Factor Robotics
            [This one is the simplest to implement]

        [3] Write own, encoder and decoder of Odrives communication protocol
            [Takes the most time, and probably the hardest]
