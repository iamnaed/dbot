[1] There is an issue in the Pilz Industrial Motion Controller
    where the last two points in the generated trajectory will have the same
    time_from_start and thus erroring out when executing the trajectory
    due to "time not strictly increasing" error
    It might be because of an uneven sample time in the final part of the trajectory

    Example
    trajectory      ----|----|----|----|-
    sample time     .04 |.04 |.04 |.04 |.01

    It is related to this github issue
